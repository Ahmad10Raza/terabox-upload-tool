# Terabox Upload Tool

A simple and efficient Node.js library for uploading files to [TeraBox](https://www.terabox.com/wap) storage. This tool streamlines the process of file uploads while offering customization options such as directory selection.

## Features

* File Upload: Easily upload files to Terabox storage.
* Custom Directory Support: Specify the directory where the file should be uploaded.
* Progress Tracking: Monitor the upload progress in real-time.


## Coming Soon (Open for Collaboration)

* Fetch Files: Retrieve the files stored in your Terabox account.
* Delete Files: Remove files from your Terabox storage directly using this library.



## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install terabox-upload-tool

```

## Getting Started

### Setting up credentials

```javascript
const TeraboxUploader = require('terabox-upload-tool');

const credentials = {
  ndus: 'valid_ndus', //Required: Get this from your session (See guide below)
  appId: 'valid_appId', //Get from session (See attached screenshots)
  uploadId: 'valid_uploadId' //Get from session (See attached screenshots)
};

```
### Uploading a File
To upload a file, create an instance of TeraboxUploader and specify the file path.

#### Example: Save File to a Specific Directory

```javascript
const uploader = new TeraboxUploader(credentials);

const filePath = './path/to/your/file.jpg';

// Uploads to '/my-uploads'
uploader.uploadFile(filePath, (uploaded, total) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${(uploaded / total * 100).toFixed(2)}%`);
}, '/my-uploads'); 
```

#### Example: Save File to Root Directly

```javascript

// Uploads to '/' 
uploader.uploadFile(filePath, (uploaded, total) => {
  console.log(`Progress: ${(uploaded / total * 100).toFixed(2)}%`);
}, '/my-uploads'); 
```

2. Delete Files:
    * Enable users to delete specific files or directories from their Terabox storage.
    * Include safeguards like confirmation prompts before deletion.

3. Error Handling Enhancements:
    * Improve error messages for easier debugging and user guidance.

4. Automated Tests:
    * Add test cases to ensure reliability and robustness.

5. Documentation Updates:

    * Expand guides with screenshots and example workflows.
